//! A `no_std` implementation of the NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1 Deterministic Random Bit Generators
//! (DRBGs).
//!
//! Three DRBG mechanisms are provided, each available behind a feature flag:
//! - **Hash DRBG** (`sha1`, `sha2`) — based on a cryptographic hash function
//! - **HMAC DRBG** (`hmac-sha1`, `hmac-sha2`) — based on HMAC
//! - **CTR DRBG** (`aes-ctr`, `tdea-ctr`) — based on a block cipher in counter mode
//!
//! All implementations follow the construction described in
//! [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/a/r1/final).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Each DRBG is instantiated with entropy, a nonce, an optional personalization string, and a
//! [`Policy`]. Once instantiated, random bytes are produced by calling [`Drbg::generate`]. The
//! DRBG must be reseeded periodically; if the reseed counter is exhausted before reseeding,
//! [`Drbg::generate`] returns [`SeedError::CounterExhausted`].
//!
//! ```rust
//! use nist_drbg_rs::{HmacSha256Drbg, Policy, Drbg};
//!
//! let entropy = [0u8; 32];
//! let nonce = [0u8; 16];
//! let personalization_string = b"";
//!
//! let mut drbg = HmacSha256Drbg::new(&entropy, &nonce, &personalization_string, Policy::default())
//!     .expect("sufficient entropy provided");
//!
//! let mut output = [0u8; 64];
//! drbg.generate(&mut output).expect("counter not exhausted");
//! ```
